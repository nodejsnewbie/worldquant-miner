# Rust Alpha Generator

This is a Rust implementation of the alpha generator.

## Installation

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

```bash
cargo run --release
```

# Python Alpha Generator

This is a Python implementation of the alpha generator.

## Introduction: Difference between Pre-Consultant and Consultant

- Pre-Consultant has maximum 5 concurrent simulations
- Pre-Consultant has fewer operators and data fields options

## Pre-Consultant

This is basically a closed loop system where it starts with alpha_generator.py, which generates alpha ideas with Kimi AI. Then it dumps promising alpha to a local log file, which promising_alpha_miner.py will mine for better results, and dumps refined alpha to a local log file, which you can run successful_alpha_submitter.py to submit to the WorldQuant platform. These script can run concurrently.

While alpha_expression_miner.py is more of a utility script to mine alpha expressions from a given expression manually but not within the aforementioned closed loop system.

alpha_101_testing is currently under development.

alpha_polisher.py is currently under development.

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

#### Alpha Generator

The pre-consultant Python alpha generator uses Kimi AI to generate alpha expressions. Notice this may get you some alpha ideas as long as you are fine with the cost.

Human in the loop control is the future development direction of this script.


```bash
python alpha_generator.py
```

#### Alpha Expression Miner

This script is used to mine alpha expressions from a given expression.

```bash
python alpha_expression_miner.py --expression "expression"


PS ~> python .\alpha_expression_miner.py --expression "cashflow_stability = ts_mean(cashflow_op, 252) / (debt_lt + 0.01);
>> stability_z = zscore(cashflow_stability);
>> debt_ratio = debt_lt / (assets + 0.01);
>> combined_score = stability_z - zscore(debt_ratio);
>> -rank(combined_score)"

```

#### Clean Up Logs

This script is used to clean up the logs.

```bash
python clean_up_logs.py
```

#### Successful Alpha Submitter

This script is used to submit successful alphas to the WorldQuant platform. It's not recommended to use this script as of now because it submits alphas in one batch instead of once per day.

```bash
python successful_alpha_submitter.py
```

## Pre-Consultant Non-AI
The `machine_lib.py` module provides core functionality for alpha generation and testing through the WorldQuant platform. Here are the key components:

### WorldQuantBrain Class
The main class that handles interactions with WorldQuant's API and alpha generation logic:

- Authentication and session management with WorldQuant platform
- Fetching and processing data fields (matrix and vector types)
- Generating alpha expressions using operators and data fields
- Running simulations to test alpha performance
- Processing and analyzing simulation results

### Key Features
- Automated alpha generation using combinations of:
  - Data fields (matrix and vector types)
  - Mathematical operators (+, -, *, /, etc.)
  - Ranking and scoring functions
  - Time series operations
- Simulation capabilities:
  - Single alpha testing
  - Batch simulation support
  - Performance metrics calculation
- Result processing:
  - Filtering based on performance thresholds
  - Storing successful alphas
  - Error handling and logging

### Data Processing
- Data field categorization (matrix vs vector)
- Expression validation
- Performance metric calculations:
  - Information Ratio (IR)
  - Returns
  - Turnover
  - Correlation analysis

The library serves as the foundation for automated alpha mining and testing, providing the necessary tools to interact with WorldQuant's platform programmatically.

```bash
python machine_miner.py --username your_worldquant_username --password your_worldquant_password
```


## Consultant

Just like the pre-consultant non ai but without workaround like single simulation and skip for inaccessible data fields and operators.


### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

```bash
python machine_miner.py --username your_worldquant_username --password your_worldquant_password
```

## Tutorial: Using Dify Components for Alpha Mining

### Prerequisites
1. Docker and Docker Compose installed
2. Python 3.8 or higher
3. Node.js 16 or higher (for web interface)

### Setting Up Dify Components

1. **Start the Dify Services**
```bash
# Start the Dify API and Web services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.middleware.yaml up -d
```

2. **Verify Services**
```bash
# Check if services are running
docker ps
```

### Using the Dify Web Interface

1. **Access the Web Interface**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Log in with your credentials

2. **Creating Alpha Mining Tasks**
   - Click on "New Task" in the web interface
   - Select "Alpha Mining" as the task type
   - Configure your mining parameters:
     - Data fields to use
     - Time period
     - Universe selection
     - Mining strategy

3. **Monitoring Mining Progress**
   - View real-time mining progress in the dashboard
   - Check generated alphas in the "Results" section
   - Export successful alphas for submission

### Using the Dify API

1. **API Authentication**
```python
import requests

API_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer your_api_key"
}
```

2. **Creating Mining Tasks**
```python
# Create a new mining task
response = requests.post(
    f"{API_URL}/api/v1/mining/tasks",
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "name": "My Mining Task",
        "data_fields": ["close", "volume", "high", "low"],
        "time_period": "1Y",
        "universe": "US",
        "strategy": "correlation"
    }
)
```

3. **Checking Task Status**
```python
# Get task status
task_id = response.json()["task_id"]
status = requests.get(
    f"{API_URL}/api/v1/mining/tasks/{task_id}",
    headers=headers
)
```

4. **Retrieving Results**
```python
# Get mining results
results = requests.get(
    f"{API_URL}/api/v1/mining/tasks/{task_id}/results",
    headers=headers
)
```

### Best Practices

1. **Resource Management**
   - Monitor system resources during mining
   - Adjust mining parameters based on available resources
   - Use appropriate timeouts for long-running tasks

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling in your API calls
   - Check task status regularly
   - Save intermediate results

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use appropriate batch sizes
   - Implement caching where possible
   - Monitor and adjust mining parameters

### Troubleshooting

1. **Service Issues**
   - Check Docker container logs: `docker logs <container_id>`
   - Verify service health: `docker-compose ps`
   - Restart services if needed: `docker-compose restart`

2. **API Issues**
   - Verify API endpoint availability
   - Check authentication tokens
   - Monitor API rate limits

3. **Mining Issues**
   - Verify data field availability
   - Check universe configuration
   - Monitor memory usage

For more detailed information about specific features and configurations, refer to the [Dify Documentation](https://docs.dify.ai).
